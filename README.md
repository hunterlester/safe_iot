- Install Docker Toolbox for Windows [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox)
- Start `Docker Quickstart Terminal`
- Create your desired directory and create a `Dockerfile` (see mine above for reference).
- Run `docker build -t <docker username>/<choose a name for image> .`, in my case I'm running `docker build -t hunterlester/safe_iot .` <--- don't forget this period
- Next we need to get a container running from the image that we just built, with a volume mounted to our host directory so that it's easy to be able to create and write files in either the container or on our host and have them be shared.
- An important detail here is that in this case `boot2docker` is the Docker host, not our Windows OS.
- Run `docker run -d -it --name <name your container> -v <path to directory on host>:/<path to directory in container> <docker username>/<image name>`
- In my case, I'm running `docker run -d -it --name safe_iot -v $(pwd):/safe_iot hunterlester/safe_iot`
- The container will be running now, detached.
- Use `docker attach <container name>` to access the command line within the container. It's in here that I'm running `nasm...`, `ld ...`, `grub-mkrescure ...`, etc...
- To exit command line without stopping container, key in `CTRL + P + Q`
- Use `docker start <container name>`, docker stop <container name>, to start and stop your container, respectively.
- If you forget your container name, use `docker ps` to view running containers and `docker ps -a` to view all containers, including those that are not running.
- I'm writing my files either in the `boot2docker` terminal or directly in Windows in my editor. Either way the files are mounted on the `boot2docker` VM and then shared with my container.
